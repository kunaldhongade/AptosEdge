## üõ† How to Use AptosEdge

### 1. Create a Multisig Wallet

Use the following command to create a multisig wallet with two admins and a threshold of two approvals:

```move
create_multisig(&signer, vector[admin1, admin2], 2);
```

### 2. Create and Confirm a Transaction

Admins can create a new transaction:

```move
create_transaction(&signer, multisig_creator, 1000, recipient_address);
```

Then confirm the transaction:

```move
confirm_transaction(&signer, multisig_creator, tx_id);
```

### 3. Execute Transactions

Admins can execute transactions after receiving sufficient confirmations:

```move
execute_transaction(&signer, multisig_creator, tx_id);
```

For batch execution:

```move
execute_batch_transactions(&signer, multisig_creator, vector[tx1, tx2, tx3]);
```

### 4. Cancel a Transaction

Cancel a pending or unexecuted transaction:

```move
cancel_transaction(&signer, multisig_creator, tx_id);
```
